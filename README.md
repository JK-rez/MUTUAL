There are two working branches in this repo: `main` and `ROS2-Foxy`. The `main` branch is the MUTUAL baseline platform optimised for recording. The ROS2-Foxy contains the ROS 2 adaptation for the baseline MUTUAL, offering more robust synchronisation and streaming capabilities. Please note this repo only provides tutorials to show case our platform, the complete source code will be released in the future.

Updates Coming Soon....
